# PantryPal Web

Welcome to the PantryPal documentation site. PantryPal is a smart pantry assistant that helps you track groceries, get recipe suggestions, and chat with an AI chef. This site provides both a **User Guide** and **Developer Guide** to help you make the most of the project.

-   [User Guide](user-guide.md)
-   [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md)

The PantryPal Web frontend communicates with the [PantryPal Backend](https://github.com/twhjames/pantrypal-backend) which exposes APIs for pantry management, account services, recipe recommendations, receipt scanning, and a conversational chatbot.
